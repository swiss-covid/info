# Epidemiological parameters and transmission patters

To anticipate further spread of COVID19 and implement the most effective containment measures accurate knowledge of how the virus spread is essential.

## Doubling times and R0
Infectious diseases spread since people carrying the virus pass it on to others.
How rapidly this happens and under what circumstances depends both on the virus and the way people interact.
Early analyses of the COVID in China have given us good estimates of these parameters and now allow us to anticipate further developments.

One central quantity is known as R0 and describes the average number of secondary infections a single infected individual triggers.
R0 has been estimated to be between 2 and 3, likely at the lower and of this range.

## When are people infectious?
From travel history to Wuhan and contact tracing in transmission chains, scientists have estimated that the average incubation period of COVID is 5 days with a wide distribution ranging from 2 days to 12 days ([Yang et al](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026328v1) OTHER REFS).

The typical serial interval, that is the time between subsequent infections in a transmission chain, was estimated to be 7-8 days, again with substantial variation. REFS
