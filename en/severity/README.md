# Severity and mortality

## Why is it difficult to estimate the case fatality ratio?

The case fatality ratio is the fraction of all cases that don't recover but die.
Estimating this number in an ongoing outbreak is difficult since

 * Many patients that are sick now have neither recovered or died and we don't know their outcome.
 * We don't know the total number of cases as mild and asymptomatic cases might not show up in the statistics.
 * Whether or not someone dies depends on the quality of care they receive and this varies from place to place and the with the burden on the health care system.

With these caveats in mind, one can nevertheless estimate mortality and severity of COVID-19 from the available data.
Such estimates are critical to prepare for growing outbreaks.


## What do we know from China?
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control have [published a comprehensive analysis](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51) of the first 72'000 cases that gives us important first indications on how dangerous COVID-19 is for individuals of different ages and different conditions.
These conclusions were drawn using data available by Feb 11.

Among the 44'000 laboratory confirmed cases, the fraction of deaths is at 0.2% or below for individuals below age 40, but rapidly rises once patients are older than 60 years.
13.8% of these cases were classified as severe, 4.7% as critical.
Half of patients classified as critical died.
The distribution of confirmed cases and deaths along with their ratio (an estimate of the case fatality ratio) is shown below:

This comprehensive reporting by Chinese health care workers, scientists, and public health officials is an invaluable resource that helps the rest of the world to prepare.

## What did we learn from outbreaks outside of China?
By now, we also have substantial information on severity and fatality rates outside of China.
The outbreak on the cruise ship "Princess Diamond", for example, provides us with data on populations that were tested extensively such that we can be confident that few cases were missed.

As of Feb 29, 705 passengers of the cruise ship have tested positive for the virus. Six passengers have died and 36 are in critical condition.
Cruise ship passengers are not a representative sample of the population.
Instead, they are likely mostly elderly.
For this demographic, the observations on the cruise ship suggest case fatality ratios above 1% (presumably some of those in critical condition will die) and about 5% critical cases ([source](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)).

Singapore has recorded 102 to date (Feb 29) with 7 critical cases and no death ([source](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/))
.
Again, Singapore is likely to have detected a large fraction of all cases and these number are compatible with the fraction of severe cases reported from China.
Most of these cases were found through contact tracing and are therefore expected to be fairly representative of the population.

Hong Kong has seen comparable numbers with 92 cases, 2 serious, 4 critical, and 2 deaths ([source](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)).


## Summary
Despite the difficulties in estimating the true number of infected individuals in China and the potentially over-burdened care facilities in Hubei, the estimates of severity and fatality ratios are fairly consistent and point to case fatality ratios of about 1%, at least in the elderly population.
Upwards of 5% of eldery fall seriously ill and require medical care.


# Comparison to other infectious diseases
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is often compared to other pandemics in the past or seasonal influenza epidemics. Some of these comparisions are useful, but other are misleading.

## 2009 pandemic influenza
The 2009 A/H1N1pdm influenza pandemic infected about 10-20% of the world's population (about 1 billion people).
This virus infected [predominantly young individuals](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70121-4/fulltext) and the case fatality ratio was low at around 3 in 10000.
While this virus spread very rapidly across the globe, it caused much less morbidity than was initially feared -- partly because the elderly were less affected.

## 1918 Spanish flu
The so-called Spanish flu was a devastating pandemic caused by the A/H1N1 influenza virus that infected around 500 million people in a population of almost 2 billion, corresponding to an attack rate just under 25%.
The death toll is estimated to have been between 50 and 100 million, corresponding to a CFR in excess of 10%.
Since this is an historic pandemic that unfolded in turbulent times, it is difficult to cleanly attribute these deaths to influenza and case fatality rate estimates remain imprecise.
The Spanish flu caused most death in young adults.

## Seasonal influenza
There are currently four lineages of seasonal influenza.
A/H1N1pdm (a descendent of the 2009 pandemic influenza), A/H3N2 (a descendent of the 1968 influenza pandemic), and two influenza B lineages.
Seasons dominated by A/H3N2 influenza tend to be most severe.

The typical attack rate in an influenza season is about 10% and around 1000 people die of influenza every year in Switzerland, corresponding to a CFR of about 0.1%.
These death are predominatly in the elderly, but in contrast to COVID-19, small children are heavily affected by seasonal influenza.
