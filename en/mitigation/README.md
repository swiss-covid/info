# Mitigation

## From containment to mitigation
 When COVID-19 appears in a country, the first step is to try and stop it from developing into a large epidemic - i.e. to contain its spread and stop the outbreak (containment phase).

 There are a number of strategies to do that. In the current situation, the two strategies are 1) to rapidly identify and isolate cases and to quarantine their contacts; and 2) to prevent new transmissions through non-pharmaceutical interventions. In such a phase, one is still able to identify (most of) the sources of infection. This is the phase we're currently at in Switzerland (2020-02-29).

 The transition from containment to mitigation is fluid. Once it becomes harder / impossible to identify the sources of many infections, and once it's clear there is increasing and potentially widespread transmission within the community, we will move to a mitigation phase. In the mitigation phase, the goal is not to stop the outbreak anymore (because this is probably impossible at this stage), but to limit its size and impact:

## Why is mitigation important?
 Upon realizing that an outbreak can perhaps not be contained, it is easy to become fatalistic and think, "ok, we didn't manage to contain it, it will spread - so why bother?" That would be a **very big mistake**. As the image above shows, mitigation has two very important effects:
 1. First, mitigation efforts help us to _reduce the magnitude_ of the epidemic at any point in time. In other words, it helps us to reduce the number of sick people at a give time (prevalence) - this is very important to reduce the burden on the health care infrastructure.
 2. Second, mitigation efforts helps us to _slow down the epidemic_, and delay many cases. This is important because it buys us valuable time during which organizations around the world are racing to develop a vaccine and new drugs (or identify existing drugs as effective in treating COVID19).

## How to mitigate
The main goal of mitigation is to make it harder for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from one person to the next (to learn more about transmission of SARS-CoV-2, please consult the [transmission section](../transmission)).

We currently do not have any **pharmaceutical interventions** at disposal. Once they become available, they will be a major tool for mitigation. When that happens is unfortunately impossible to predict at this point.

Until that happens, we can start to use **non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)**. These can be community-based, or individual-based.

- __Isolation and Quarantine__: Isolation is to cut off infected people from others. This is of course absolutely key - doing that will directly prevent transmission. Quarantine, on the other, is about cutting off _exposed, i.e. potentially infected_ people from others. This is done when there is a sufficient risk of a person, or a group of people, being exposed and thus potentially infected, and it helps prevent reduce transmission in case the person(s) are indeed infected. Isolation and quarantine can be both individual measures (i.e. isolating one person) or community measures (i.e. quarantining entire cities). 


### Personal Interventions
- __Hand washing__: Hand washing is one of the most easy and effective tools at anyone's disposal to help slow down the spread of COVID19. Frequent and _thorough_ hand washing has been shown repeatedly to hamper the spread of infectious diseases. This [US CDC webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/why-handwashing.html) contains a lot of useful information and references to scientific papers that systematically evaluated hand washing.

- __Respiratory etiquette__: If you sneeze or cough, cover your mouth, ideally with a disposable tissue (dispose it!) of into your elbow. The point is to not just cough / sneeze into the open, and too not cough into your hand, because then you're likely to touch surface and deposit viral particles on those surfaces.

- __Stay at home when ill__: Once you begin to have symptoms because of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, you are very likely already infectious (see [SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Upper Respiratory Specimens of Infected Patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001737)). Thus, if you feel typical COVID19 symptoms coming on - high temperature and a cough - call a doctor or the local hotline (Swiss hotline: +41 58 463 00 00, 24 hours) and follow their instructions.

- __Avoiding physical contact__: When respiratory droplets are deposited on the hand (especially when not following the cough etiquette of coughing in your elbow, or when touching contaminated surfaces such as door handles), it is easy to pass them on through handshakes. Avoiding physical contact through handshakes, kissing, or other greetings that involve skin-based contact, can help reduce transmission.  

- __Wearing maks__: Wearing masks can have two effects. First, when ill, a mask helps limit the spread of respiratory particles to others. Second, N95 masks also are known to reduce the chance of getting infected. These masks should be reserved to health care personal and other people known to be exposed to infectious people.

### Community Interventions

- __Prevention of large gatherings__: This is currently in effect in Switzerland since February 28, 2020. The federal government banned events of more than a thousands people, and left the decision about smaller events to the cantonal authorities. While this may understandably be extremely disappointing news to event organizers and event goers, this decision is solidly grounded in mitigation science. Large gatherings provide ample opportunities for disease transmission, and will make contract tracing incredibly hard.

- __Travel restrictions and bans__: Travel restrictions and travel bans are based on the idea that large-distance transmission can be avoided.

- __School closures__: Schools are known to be very fertile ground for respiratory disease transmission, due to the generally lower hygienic standards of children, and their close proximity. For this reason, school closures are often use to fight respiratory disease spread. For COVID19, the effect of school closures is relatively unclear because the role of children COVID transmission is unclear. Children seem to get sick very rarely, but too little is known about whether they also get less infected, and perhaps most importantly, how infectious they are.

It's important to note that each NPI has its downsides. Everything comes at cost - this is particularly true for community interventions. Thus, making the decision to implement such interventions must be  carefully weight against its downside. The goal is not to make our lives harder - the goal is to make the live of the virus harder, i.e. to reduce its transmission potential.
