## Mitigation

# From containment to mitigation
 When COVID-19 appears in a country, the first step is to try and stop it from developing into a large epidemic - i.e. to contain its spread and stop the outbreak (containment phase).

 There are a number of strategies to do that. In the current situation, the two strategies are 1) to rapidly identify and isolate cases and to quarantine their contacts; and 2) to prevent new transmissions through non-pharmaceutical interventions. In such a phase, one is still able to identify (most of) the sources of infection. This is the phase we're currently at in Switzerland (2020-02-29).

 The transition from containment to mitigation is fluid. Once it becomes harder / impossible to identify the sources of many infections, and once it's clear there is increasing and potentially widespread transmission within the community, we will move to a mitigation phase. In the mitigation phase, the goal is not to stop the outbreak anymore (because this is probably impossible at this stage), but to limit its size and impact:
